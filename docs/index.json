Also, you are welcome to submit a jupyter notebook for lab02 if you are having trouble with the pdf (this can be fixed by deleting the cartoon though). [Please note though….working through problems of a technical nature is the type of technical fluency we are looking to build in this class. We want you to develop an appreciation of the connections between things like packages, data type, computing environment as part of this class.]\nThree issues where identified thus far:\n(1) You may get an error with the installation of dependencies if just working locally. Instead open up an Anaconda prompt/terminal and issue the following commands:\nconda install -y pip pip install git+https://github.com/grading/gradememaybe.git  The solution I demonstrated in class of copying the requirements.txt will also work.\n(2) You may get a conflict with matplotlib and gradememaybe For lab.analyticsdojo.com you can temporarily uninstall matplotlib with:\n!conda uninstall -y matplotlib  (3) You may get an error on HM02 q26.

You will need a number of different systems setup on your computer for this class.\nWe will be testing this semester a online JupyterHub instance that should simplify a lot of the setup. However this is still in an alpha release and it would be good to get an alternate compute environment setup on your laptop.\nIn describing options, there are cloud and laptop based ways of doing the exercises.\nCloud A cloud based way of doing data science doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to install anything and you can be up and running in working with concepts asap.\nOur Cloud: lab.analyticsdojo.com For the cloud instance at lab.analyticsdojo.com, there is some cool technology that is driving this. We are utilizing Kubernetes on the Google Cloud Platform to run Jupyterhub. This is based on some amazing work by a talented community of open source developers.\nWhen someone logs into the platform, the students obtain their own container to run on, giving them access to a compute environment that is much more flexible than a typical brower.\n##Laptop When running on your laptop, there are 2 different configuration options that that are possible.\nFor most users, managing the analytics environment with Anaconda seems to work quite well. Anaconda is a package manager with detailed instructions for Mac/Windows/Linux users. In this clase\nIt is also possible to run Docker on your laptop, mirroring the same compute environment that you enjoyed on JupyterHub cloud environment. This has worked perfectly in the past for Mac users and not so well for Windows users, but I understand Docker for Windows has come a long way.\nPlease feel free to post issues on the Slack channel.\nFollow the instructions to install git/GitHub Desktop and Anaconda.\n"

	"content": " The MS Business Analytics Capstone Course The Business Analytics capstone is the culminating experience of our Masters Program in Business Analytics. Students work in small groups, supervised by an experienced Faculty member, to provide data insights to client organizations. ​ Skills you can expect to have within the team: Python, R, SQL, Statistics, Advanced analytics models and algorithms.\nStudents will also have specialized knowledge in areas such as end-user software (e.g. SAS or SPSS Modeler); Natural Language Processing; or Econometrics (time series).\nFinally, being in the Masters program, our students have domain knowledge based on their undergraduate education and prior work experience. Many of our students come from an Engineering or a Finance background. We also have several student athletes.\nGenerally, there are some core types of projects.\nAnalytics and Business Process  Have a business process some data but not sure of role of analytics? The team can provide initial exploratory analysis to develop an approach that could have one of the above elements.  Predictive Modeling  Prediction of a specific aspect of a business process.  Dashboarding  Business visibility to key performance metrics.  Business Understanding  Want to better understand a key aspect of a business process through analysis and visualization? Teams can generate business understanding.  Prototyping  Developing an analytics product as a part of an existing product or services? The team can prototype.  Spring 2019 Examples  These are some examples of projects from Spring 2019.     Company Name Brief Description of Project (1-2 Sentences)     Mind Genomics Automating creation of categories and bag of words for each category for Nissan dealerships using text analysis, scraping, SPSS Modeler etc.   Outmatch Making improvement of the existing model to Outmatch to get a better prediction of the candidateâ€™s performance. Our final goal is to select the proper combination of independent factors and modeling for better prediction.   ReceiptHQ Our Capstone Team works with a Troy based startup- ReceiptHQ. Through the use of Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s PowerBi, a dashboard is created for ReceiptHQ to help restaurant owners understand performance, gain insights, and take action.   IBM CISL This project is studying the engagement between angel groups and startups on twitter. We are aiming at offering visualizations of aggregated data from CrunchBase and Twitter to help angel groups in CISL boardroom select startups as their investment.   Financial Institution The sales division has a subjective probability structure to understand the closing of new business deals, in the CRM system. Goal is to explore how effective the probability weightings are and the timings of the opportunities.   Auto/Mate We are using the sales force data of Auto/Mate to uncover how various operational and marketing decisions influence the customers to complete the deal. Also, our analysis uncovers the reasons why customers move on to the competitors and potential bottlenecks stopping the deal from happening successfully.   Cortex To provide a series of recommendations to Cortex regarding social media posts for the travel industry. These posts should recommend new areas (factors) that are not currently being used by the particular client. These recommendations should include, but are not limited to, colors used, post subjects, and objects.   New York State-Department of Health We are analyzing how much people have to travel from one place to the other in order to health care access. The reasons behind the travel and the other hospitals that have been passed by while travelling are researched on.   CommerceHub Develop a methodology and algorithms to aggregate similar products in CommerceHubâ€™s order stream.   deFacto Global Research and provide a robust implementation for new forecasting models into their current software.   Advantage Media Inc. We were able to improve AMI\u0026rsquo;s visualization and report creation by leveraging MS Power BI. A predictive model was also developed to help give added insight on the costs of spot rates throughout the year.   PUBG MadGlory The client, PUBG Madglory, produces a free-use API which allows community developers to access in-game player and match data. This project will provide critical educational literature and use cases for the PUBG API around data generation as well as opportunities to perform advanced modeling techniques on that player/match data.    Faculty Jason Kuruzovich Jason is an academic entrepreneur that works on problems in which analytics can have a meaningful impact on the world.

For this lab we will begin the process of learning visualization through the See Click Fix Kaggle Project. Go ahead and download the train file from Github or from the Dropbox/Kaggle folder.\nThe first part of any data visualization project is data understanding. Start with the process of understanding the data fields and the context of the data.\n(1). IN YOUR OWN WORDS, describe what the data involves and key fields that are identified.\nImport the Data. You should be able to do this using the instructions from class and the video. We want to get started with identifying the data on a map. Drag the Longitude to the column and the Latitude to the rows.\nFilter the Data. We have 4 cities here but we only want one of them. We need to create a filter that selects based on the longitude/latitude to only show one city.\n(2). IN YOUR OWN WORDS, describe the filter you created to select only one city.\nChange the type to a Map. Select on the Show Me map to show your city on a map. (This actually happens automatically).\nTag Type. Drag the tags over to the colors and select filter and add. Select just a few tags.\nUnderstand Tags. Create a new worksheet and drag Tag Type from the dimensions and create a visualization that is sorted by the count of the number of tags.\n(3). Provide an image showing the 5 most frequent tag types.\n(4). Create 4 visualizations that help you to understand more details about the data or make a specific point. At least one should use the Map. Provide 1-3 sentences to describe each visualization.\nHere are some examples.\n"

	"content": " Midterm The goal for the midterm is to spend some time reviewing some of the basic processes that we have utilized thus far. Basic concepts, syntax, and processes which will be useful in data science projects.\nThe midterm will consist of 2 sections.\nPart 1: Multiple Choice/Short answer The first section will be closed book/closed notes. You should understand conceptual issues with the class, technologies, packages, CRISP model, etc. If given a piece of code, you should be able to interpret what it does. In this section, you won’t be asked to generate any code though.\nPart 2: Coding Like the homework, there will be sections where you need to write specific code responses to questions, similar to the homework. You are allowed to bring a 1 page (both sides) or 2 pages (1 side each) of a crib sheet with syntax for use only in part 2. Examples will largely come from the homeworks and classroom examples.\nPart 1 Sample Questions.\n _______ is the Python package that enables a data frame object? a) DF b) DATA-FRAME c) Pandas d) Beautiful Soup e) Numpy\n Below is an example of what type of encoding? { \u0026ldquo;year\u0026rdquo;: 1997, \u0026ldquo;make\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;Ford\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;model\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;E350\u0026rdquo;, }, a) Delimited file b) XML c) JSON d) ODBC e) SQL\n  Part 2 Sample Questions.\n(After given a sample dataframe.)\n Using python, recode the variable from a character type to numeric and the gender to 0/1 for male/female.\n Perform one hot encoding for the x field of the dataframe.\n Take the mean of the y variable of the dataframe.\n  Appeal process If you feel one of your solutions will work but was marked off, you can do the following:\n Take a picture of the question and solution.\n Accept the midterm-appeal assignment.\n Test if the solution works.\n If your solution does work but was marked off, add a markdown cell with the original picture and commit/push the example.\n Provide a Slack message to Jason Kuruzovich and Lianlian Jiang with a link to the repository.\n  Your solution must work 100%. You cannot use this method to request additional partial credit.\nData is here: https://github.com/techfundamentals-fall2017/midterm-starter\n"

Just click on the button to accept the assignment. Accepting the assignment will create a git repository that you will use to submit assignments. Most will be private, and they should be of the form:\nhttps://github.com/techfundamentals-fall20XX/hm-xx-\u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;  Homework Assignments from one class will be due the following Wednesday by 11:59 PM. This allows for time to ask about an assignment.\nThese are instructions for submitting labs and assignments lab. We will be using Github Classroom to distribute and collect all assignments. This is new for this semester so expect some bumps.\nThe advantage to this is that you will be learning to work with real tools while submitting assignments.\nStep 1: Clone the private repository  Clone the repository created when you have accepted the assignment. Just accept the assignment again (see above) if you forget or can\u0026rsquo;t find it).  Note: The command should look something like this. You will need to update it to the appropriate repository URL.*\ngit clone https://github.com/techfundamentals-fall20XX/hm-xx-\u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;  Step 2: Do the assignment.  Complete the assignment.  Step 3: Add your changes.  Add your changes to the repository using the command line or GitHub Desktop.  To add all changed files via the command line, you must be in the homework directory.\ncd hm-xx-\u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;  Then you must add the files you have changed to git. The -A command is telling git to add all of the files. While you could name the files directly, this is the easiest way.\ngit add -A  Step 4: Commit your changes.  Add your changes to the repository using the command line or GitHub Desktop.\ngit commit -m \u0026quot;insert your commit message here\u0026quot;  Step 5: Push your changes. Push your changes to the remote repository.\ngit push  The program should prompt you for your username and password.\n  Step 6: Verify your code.  At the time the homework is due the final code in the repository will be tagged as the submissions and future commits won\u0026rsquo;t be evaluated. View your repository on GitHub and make sure that all of your commits have been pushed.  I\u0026rsquo;ve put together a Jupyter Notebook we will use in class to go over the basics of git. In addition, there are a number of resources posted to the git resources tab. Post to the #homeworks tab on Slack.\n"

Project Objective The goal is to develop an understanding of how individuals approach data science projects, seeing the entire process from exploratory data analysis to modeling and evaluation.\nProject Selection Ongoing.\nIf you feel there is another Kaggle contest you would like to do, just ask in the #projects slack channel. You should make sure that there are existing solutions (kernels) and make sure that there is business relevance. You should avoid image based data or projects that only require visualizations.\nDeliverables  Executive Summary This should be 1 page summary in your own words of the problem, data, and findings. Data description and initial processing. This section should include basic characterization of data. You should run and report basic statistics on the data and generate 3 visualizations. You can review other kernels to understand some different approaches to the data, but this section you are required to generate all analyses (3 pages). Modeling and evaluation of 3 other solutions. Identify 3 other Kaggle solutions completed by others. You can do this by selecting on the project and then clicking on the link to Kernels. Summarize the features, modeling approach, and performance in a table. Then do some further research to comment on (2 pages) Modeling. Modeling should examine relevance of different independent variables (features) and different algorithms. Summary. A summary of overall findings. Appendix. A github repository of all modeling, well commented code.  NOTE: If you copy and paste from the Kaggle description that is plagiarism and you will be reported to the Associate Dean\u0026rsquo;s office and receive a 0 on the project grade.\nProject Evaluation Metrics. The description below describes an ideal project. Projects will be evaluated subjectively by the instructor according to this rubric.\n Formatting (10 points). The student presented the report in a format that indicated professionalism and care in the organization, writing, and presentation of the overall report.\n Executive summary (20 points, 1 page). The student was able to present the results of modeling in a way that is rich and interesting as well. There is clear representation of key predictors and key algorithms used.\n Data description and initial processing (40 points. 3 pages). The student was able to clearly present an overall picture of the data using techniques presented in the class. This includes basic structure field by field descriptions as well as visualization and basic statistics. Where necessary they have adequately used techniques for cleaning the data or generating new features.\n Modeling and Evaluation(30 points, 2 pages). There is a clear insightful comparison of approaches, and he predictive characteristics of the different models are clearly compared in a table with appropriate conclusions. There are outside resources consulted in the description of specific algorithms if relevant.\n Analysis of relevance of independent variables (25 points. 1.5-2 pages). The student was able to clearly present justification of the value of different independent variables. Where possible, exploration of feature creation is provided.\n Analysis of performance of different model types (25 points, 1.5-2 pages). There are outside resources consulted in the description of specific algorithms if relevant. Outside sources give clarity and there is evidence of some model tuning.\n Commented Code (20 points, as needed). Clearly commented code has been provided in the assigned Jupyter notebook.\n  Project Submission  *The project report is to be submitted to the LMS. The code is to be supported via Github classroom.  NOTE: If you copy and paste from the Kaggle description that is plagiarism and you will be reported to the Associate Dean\u0026rsquo;s office and receive a 0 on the project grade.\nAccept the Project Assignment  "

Critical to creating data literate graduates.\nFor the Data 8 class, the University of California at Berkley has developed an open [curriculum]() and extensive teaching infrastructure (online textbook, auto-grader, Jupyter-based cloud computing infrastructure for data science) created the worlds largest data science class.\nThis proposal suggests creating an instance of the Data 8 class @ Rensselaer. All materials for the Data 8 course have been released under a compatible Creative Commons license.\nThis course integrates programming, statistics, and analysis in a single course using the Python programming language.\nSharing of highly developed classes from one university to another has had a positive impact in other cases. For example, CS50 @ Yale-companion course to Harvard\u0026rsquo;s popular introductory CS course-was the most popular course at Yale last year.\nBringing a well developed curriculum regarding data science to campus would provide an extremely well documented platform on which to build additional bridge course, which could follow the Connector Courses model but be aligned with the Unique offerings of Rensselaer.\nFollowing the marketing of the course at Berkley, Data 8 @ Rensselaer would be cross-listed as an introductory course across a variety of disciplines, potentially including ITWS, MATH, MGMT, ISYE, and any other areas that would see value.\n"

Here is a list of a few projects where you could get involved.\n Autograding with TravisCI. As part of this class we incorporate tests as a way to see that the the student has completed the assignment. However, there is a risk that students could \u0026ldquo;fake the tests\u0026rdquo; and as a result not do the work. There are some prototypes around for using TravisCI and as a testing mechanism. There is also an open source project called Submitty that has been developed locally. I\u0026rsquo;d like some help figuring out autograding.\n Kuberlytics. Currently there are a number of students from the RPI Center for Open Source (RCOS) working on a project called Kuberlytics. We have started looking at different ways Kubernetes could be used in data science. Lots of opportunity and a new Google project called kubeflow has me really excited that Kubernetes. I\u0026rsquo;m looking for help in documenting ways of launching things on Kubernetes, as we started here in the launch project.\n  Some specifics related to 2.\n(a.) Solidify deployments for Jupyterhub using new version of helm chart (enabling ssl.), load testing of Jupyterhub server, shared storage. (b.) Work on deployment of Airflow on Kubernetes. Airflow can be used to (c.) Simplified python package for committing code. (d.) Demonstration cases of installing and using pachyderm.\n Entrepreneurship and Big Unstructured Data. I\u0026rsquo;m currently working as part of Kuberlytics and CISL to assemble data related to startups for additional analysis. Current data collections involve, Crunchbase, Twitter, \u0026amp; Kickstarter. However, additional efforts are needed to pull things together and start some interesting visualizations and modeling.  Some specific use cases from 3.\n(a.) How can we understand \u0026ldquo;pivots\u0026rdquo; in a companies strategy and in the introduction of new products and services? While the web is a way for companies to enact their strategies. By observing website changes over time, we can understand shifts in strategies. But how can we observe shifts in strategies over time? The Internet Wayback machine is an effort to capture websites at different periods of time. The first objective of this subproject is to develop capabilities to extract website data in a way that can be further analyzed. This python package might help py-wayback, but it is a bit dated. No existing work has been done in this area.\n(b.) Crunchbase API. Crunchbase has one of the premier sources of company data, providing an index of the startup community over time. Currently, while much data is available through direct download, some additional data requires Because of the licensing agreement, this repository is private and all people associated with the project have to sign a terms of service agreement. The goal is to build on the crunch-time. In addition to data manipulation and management, there is a need to use Gensim topic modeling and cosine similarity as in this paper\n(c.) Kickstarter. While quiet a lot of work has been done one understanding Kickstarter, less work has examined how organizations utilize Kickstarter. In particular, we suggest that Kickstarter can be an alternative to fund raising. We have started the process of collecting data and just need to link it to different datasets. See github.\nOther datasets that could be relevant include patents, news, etc.\nCrunchbase 2013 Data\nJoin the Kuberlytics slack (make sure you have a pic) If working on startup data make sure you turn on notifications for the #startupdata channel. Kuberlytics Slack\n(b.) Crunchbase API. Crunchbase has one of the premier sources of company data, providing an index of the startup community over time. Currently, while much data is available through direct download, some additional data requires Because of the licensing agreement, this repository is private and all people associated with the project have to sign a terms of service agreement. The goal is to build on the crunch-time. In addition to data manipulation and management, there is a need to use Gensim topic modeling and cosine similarity as in this paper\nSteps. 1. Get familiar with what crunchbase is..view website. 2. Download Crunchbase 2013 Data\nGroup A 3. Modeling group..request access to repository\u0026hellip;.. Install Gensim. Load Company CSV. Load to Pandas. Read about topic modeling and review MISQ paper. Try topic modeling. Figure out cosine similarity.\nGroup B 4. API group. Request Access to repository. Fill out form and say you are working with me. Try accessing API using crunch-time (need api access) and figure out how to pull Founder and School data.\n"

	"content": " Autonomous RC Racing @Rensselaer\u0026rdquo; description = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; weight = 20 +++\nData literacy is a foundational component of a modern technical and scientific education. Critical to creating data literate graduates.\nFor the Data 8 class, the University of California at Berkley has developed an open [curriculum]() and extensive teaching infrastructure (online textbook, auto-grader, Jupyter-based cloud computing infrastructure for data science) created the worlds largest data science class.\nThis proposal suggests creating an instance of the Data 8 class @ Rensselaer. All materials for the Data 8 course have been released under a compatible Creative Commons license.\nThis course integrates programming, statistics, and analysis in a single course using the Python programming language.\nSharing of highly developed classes from one university to another has had a positive impact in other cases. For example, CS50 @ Yale-companion course to Harvard\u0026rsquo;s popular introductory CS course-was the most popular course at Yale last year.\nBringing a well developed curriculum regarding data science to campus would provide an extremely well documented platform on which to build additional bridge course, which could follow the Connector Courses model but be aligned with the Unique offerings of Rensselaer.\nFollowing the marketing of the course at Berkley, Data 8 @ Rensselaer would be cross-listed as an introductory course across a variety of disciplines, potentially including ITWS, MATH, MGMT, ISYE, and any other areas that would see value.\n"
