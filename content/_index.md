Welcome to the alpha version of the RPI AnalyticsDojo, an infrastructure for teaching and learning analytics.

Currently the learning stack associated with these courses includes: (1) Jupyterhub (2) GitHub Classroom (3) Travis-CI Based Autograding and (4) Slack. The idea is by adopting a common tecnology stack across different classes, we will be better able to coordinate learning.
